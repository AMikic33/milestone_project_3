# WFPB RECIPES

This project promotes the WFPB diet. The website can be used by users who are already following this lifestyle and the beginners alike.
The website enables the user to create their own recipe collection, share their recipes with others, and find an inspiration by trying recipes posted by other users.


## UX

The project was designed to allow users to create their own online recipe book, avoid endless online search for a particular recipe, share their recipes with other users

and be able to easily find new recipes that suit their lifestyle.

In case a user wants to look for a specific kind of recipes, there is a search field on the home page, that find recipes based on category, cuisine or a recipe name.

Through CRUD functionality, the project enables the user to create, read, edit and delete their own recipes.

The register / login option serves as an additional data protection and ensures that only the user can edit or delete their own recipes.


#### User Stories

As a user, I want:

- to have all of my recipes in the same place
- to be able to add a new recipe to my already existing collection
- to be able to manage my own recipe collection, by being able to edit or delete recipes
- to make sure that no one else can change or delete my own recipes
- to be able to share my recipes with my friends and/ or people who follow the same lifestyle
- to be able to easily find recipes from a certain country
- to be able to see only recipes from a certain category, e.g. desserts



#### Wireframes

As there are many pages to this project, I have included the wireframes in a separate document.

Please see the wireframes.md file for the entire collection of wireframes:
